
Interpreter pattern,Observer pattern,State pattern,Memento pattern are used.

Functionality:

1. Evaluate postfix expressions. The expression (1967 + 21) * sin(3) will be 1967 21 + 3 sin * in postfix. 
You should support at least the operations +, -, *, / , lg (base 2) and sin. You may
restrict the input to integer values. However the result may be a floating point number since we
are including lg and sin. Postfix is used here to simplify the parsing. If you prefer to use normal
arithmetic expressions you may.

2. Implement a spreadsheet with 9 cells with a GUI. The cells are labeled $A, $B, $C, $D, $E,
$F, $G, $H, $I. (If you prefer you can use a 2-dimensional layout with the cells labeled $A$A,
$A$B, $A$C, $B$A, $B$B, etc) A cell can contain either a formula, a number or be empty. A
formula can contain numbers, reference to cells and the operations. In the first example below
cell $A contains 1, $B contains the number 2, $C contains the formula $A $B +, and $E contains
the formula $A $C +. We have an equation and a value view of the cells. The two tables
below shows both the equation and the value views of the cells. Provide the user with a button
to switch between views. That is you display the spreadsheet once and the user can toggle the
view between the two views by clicking on a button. You need to provide a way for the user to
enter values and equations. You either allow the user to enter the values directly in a cell or
provide them with a separate input field to enter values and/or equations.


Value View
$A  $B   $C   $D  $E $F $G $H $I
2    3    5    8

Equation View
$A  $B    $C     $D    $E $F $G $H $I
2   3    $A$B+  $B$C+

While in the value view if a user changes the value of a cell (for example cell $B) then all cells
dependent on that cell need to be updated automatically. Note that more than one cell may require
updating. One may be tempted to update all the cells whenever a user modifies one
cell. However this will not scale to a really spreadsheet, so do not do it. When a user
modifies one cell only update the cells that are effected by the change.

In this example above three cells depend on $A. If the user changes the value in cell $A all the
values in the other cells need to be updated. Note that which cells depend on which cell is
completely determined by the user. 

3. Add an undo mechanism to your spreadsheet. The undo mechanism should be unlimited.
However the undo history does not have to span multiple invocations of the program. That is
when you start the program your undo history can start empty. Each change the user makes in
either a value or an equations is to be undoable.
